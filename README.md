# hello-world

I am here to learn how to code.  I need to learn how to code because I injured my back working for UPS and I can no longer do physically demanding work.  I earned a BA degree in history nearly 2 years ago from a good school, but I have since discovered that it is not much more than a useless scrap of paper.  I have always been a fan of the skilled trades and I believe that coding is the ultimate skilled trade.
